PredictionIO is an open source Machine Learning Server. It empowers developers
and data scientists to build smart applications with data productively.

PredictionIO currently offers 2 basic engine templates for Apache Spark MLlib:

* [Recommendation](/templates/recommendation/quickstart/) - with MLlib ALS
* [Classification](/templates/classification/quickstart/) - with MLlib Naive Bayes

It also offers an engine template with more business logics:

* [Similar Product](/templates/similarproduct/quickstart/) - with MLlib ALS and Cosine Similarity

With these templates, you can create a custom predictive engine for production deployment efficiently:

* predict user behaviors and demand
* offer personalized video, news, deals, ads and job openings
* help users to discover interesting events, documents, apps and restaurants
* spam detection
* and more...

A standard PredictionIO stack is built on top of solid open source technology,
such as Scala, Apache Spark, HBase and Elasticsearch.
